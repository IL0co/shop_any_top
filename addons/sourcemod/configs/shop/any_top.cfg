//?			The format of the received data. All db id data is obtained as a string.
//?			For example, let's analyze "%32s24": 
//?				32 is the number of characters that will be in the string (if there are no characters, there will be a space). 
//?				24 is the maximum length of the string (trimmed by this number).
//?			Responses are separated by a coma `,`. The position is counted in turn.
//			"#format"				"%32s24,%s"
//?			Position format, how it will look in the menu. 
//?				{id} - replaced with a place, 
//?				{number} - replaced by the response string from the database, the number is its position in the request.
//			"Item Format"			"{id}. {2} - {1}"
//?			Whether to fill in the missing places on the last page with emptiness?
//			"Fill The Void"			"1"

//!		Next are the names of the items, they can be taken from the translation file if the keys match.
//			"Menu Name"				"Top 100 inv"
//			"Menu Tittle"			"Top 100 inv"
//?			Text after title.
//			"Header"				" "
//?			Text after places (or before buttons back, forward, exit).
//			"Footer"				" "

//!		Names of buttons in the menu. The default translation for them is taken from the core.phrases.txt file (there are names for all menus).
//			"Back Button"			"Back"
//			"Next Button"			"Next"
