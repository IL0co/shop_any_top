//?			The format of the received data. All db id data is obtained as a string.
//?			For example, let's analyze "%32s24": 
//?				32 is the number of characters that will be in the string (if there are no characters, there will be a space). 
//?				24 is the maximum length of the string (trimmed by this number).
//?			Responses are separated by a coma `,`. The position is counted in turn.
//			"#format"				"%32s24,%s"
//?			Position format, how it will look in the menu. 
//?				{id} - replaced with a place, 
//?				{number} - replaced by the response string from the database, the number is its position in the request.

//?			Whether to fill in the missing places on the last page with emptiness?
